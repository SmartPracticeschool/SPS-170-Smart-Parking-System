Smart Parking System

In this project a new parking system called Smart Parking System (SPS) is proposed to assist drivers to find vacant spaces in a car park in a shorter time. The new system uses ultrasonic sensors to detect either car park occupancy or improper parking actions.

We have completed this project using Tinkercad Simulator for Making connections and Implementing the code.
